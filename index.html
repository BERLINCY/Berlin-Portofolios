                    Artworks and illustrations were my gateway to the creative industry which led to the foundation of
                    my own studio and to first steps in the digital world.
                    A user-centered mindset and sensitivity for design turned out to be the perfect fit when
                    collaborating with agencies, clients and brands to develop digital concepts and solve problems
                    together.

                    Art Direction
                    Starting with basic websites several years ago I found myself working as an Art Director for complex
                    projects with a holistic approach soon. Visually appealing designs, subtle details and brand
                    guidelines combined to innovative interfaces across various touch points became my daily companion.
                    Out of this love for aesthetic design my passion for functionality and structure evolved. Jumping
                    right into Photoshop didn’t feel accurate anymore and skipping the steps of building a framework
                    based on functionality and usability became inevitable.
